## Unit Testing Example - Palindrome Checker

This is a simple program to demonstrate unit testing principles. The program will prompt the user to enter a string (in the console) and the program will tell the user whether the string is a Palindrome or not. It will then prompt for a new string and repeat this process until the user types "exit".

There are unit tests for the palindrome checking and the control flow for prompting the user.~~~~
